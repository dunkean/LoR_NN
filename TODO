Critical:
---------
Continue button detected at 184:87 after match sometimes (detection bug or timing bug - fixed on lower window dimension)
Detection bug on hp/atk (to do complete testing)

Important:
----------
Cast b4 attack instead of direct attack to kill
Drag attackers by blocks (look into deployed to see neighbors)

Desired:
--------
Globally optimize/simplify attackers and blockers brute search (ie. remove duplicates with same unit)
Detect Stun, Elusive, Barrier, ? Spell Barrier ? and potentially all buffs / debuffs icons
Consider Scout in combat phase

Exciter:
--------
Improve challenger/Vulnerable usage in search (is worst result better with challenge ?)
Cast new units event if 6 depployed
